          The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the only
          probiotic formulation recommended and recognized by name in the
          American College of Gastroenterology AGA guidelines for the management
          of pouchitis and other pouch-related disorders (Olleik et al.,
          Gastroenterology, Vol. 164, No. 6, 2023).
        </p>

        <p>
          The European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization (ECCO) has included the
          De Simone Formulation in its guidelines for the management of
          Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) (ECCO, ECCO News, 2023).
        </p>

        <p>
          CDS22-formula is highly effective in the dietary management of various
          gastrointestinal conditions. The extensive scientific evidence,
          comprising over 200 peer-reviewed articles and more than 80 controlled
          clinical studies, ensures that the benefits observed in clinical
          trials are replicable in everyday use

          Why Does It <span class="pink">Work?</span>
        </h1>

        <p>
          Not all probiotics are the same. The overall biological action of a
          probiotic is not simply the sum of its individual components’ actions
          but the result of a complex network of relationships between the
          microorganisms it contains and the human host. Unlike many other
          products on the market, the clinical results obtained from
          CDS22-formula speak louder than any technical description.
        </p>

        <p>
          CDS22-formula combines 8 bacterial strains selected for their
          biochemical and enzymatic profiles and specifically calibrated in
          precise proportions to synergistically act on the physiology of the
          human gastrointestinal tract. It is crucial to emphasize that the
          production of the Formulazione De Simone falls within the field of
          biology, not chemistry, as the bacteria forming the product’s base are
          living organisms. Their cultivation requires advanced scientific
          knowledge and specific know-how, still protected by industrial
          secrecy.
        </p>

        <p>
          The unique and advanced know-how developed by Prof. Claudio De Simone,
          which includes specific industrial secrets, contributes to the
          uniqueness and efficacy of CDS22-formula, making it extremely
          difficult for others to replicate or produce an identical or
          functionally equivalent product. Supported by solid scientific
          evidence, CDS22-formula is highly effective in the dietary management
          of dysbiosis and other gastrointestinal conditions, offering proven
          and replicable clinical results.

          CDS22-formula supports the dietary management of intestinal dysbiosis,
          contributing to well-being in cases of intestinal disorders connected
          to irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and paucities.

        <p>
          <span>Control of intestinal dysbiosis:</span><br />Intestinal
          dysbiosis is a condition where the natural balance of microorganisms
          in the intestine is altered, causing various gastrointestinal
          disorders. Controlling dysbiosis is crucial for maintaining digestive
          health, improving patient comfort, and contributing to overall
          well-being, even in cases of chronic intestinal disorders like
          irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Immediate and prolonged restoration of intestinal flora:</span
          ><br />
          CDS22-formula is ideal for both acute and chronic episodes of
          intestinal dysbiosis. It reduces the severity and duration of
          symptoms, improving patient comfort and accelerating recovery. It is
          particularly indicated for supporting intestinal health and can be
          beneficial in cases of temporary or chronic intestinal disorders
          characterized by accelerated transit that prevents normal daily
          activities or adequate night rest.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Variety of Dosages:</span><br />
          Available in different formats and dosages to support intestinal
          health and adapt to individual dietary needs, offering flexibility to
          healthcare professionals in personalizing supplementation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Original Formulation:</span><br />
          CDS22-formula is the original FormulazionDe Simone, a unique
          combination of proprietary bacterial strains designed to maximize
          intestinal well-being. The strains are cultivated and maintained in
          proprietary Master Cell Banks, ensuring purity, quality, and
          consistency in every production.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Guaranteed Safety:</span><br />
          Every dose has been tested to ensure maximum efficacy and safety.
          Thanks to a short supply chain approved by the inventor, the product
          maintains the highest quality standards from raw material to
          packaging.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Affordability:</span><br />
          CDS22-formula offers superior value compared to probiotics containing
          equivalent quantities of bacteria. Efficient production and direct
          cost control allow us to offer a more affordable product on the
          market.

          <span class="highlight">Formulation</span>
        </h1>
        <p>
          The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the result of
          pioneering research by Professor Claudio De Simone (MD, FAGA), who
          redefined therapeutic approaches to intestinal health by introducing
          the use of high-concentration probiotic mixtures to dietetically
          manage acute and chronic gastrointestinal disorders. <br /><br />
          His interest in the intestinal microbiota dates back to the 1980s when
          the importance of the intestinal flora’s role was just beginning to be
          understood. Professor De Simone is an honorary member of the American
          College of Gastroenterology and, after graduating in Medicine and
          Surgery, specialized in gastroenterology, allergology, and clinical
          immunology. He taught Infectious Diseases at the University of
          L’Aquila (Italy).
          <br /><br />
          He has published over 200 clinical studies, scientific articles, and
          book chapters.
          <br /><br />
          Since the commercial launch of his renowned De Simone Formulation in
          the 1990s, the Professor has actively advocated for better regulation
          and quality control of probiotics, highlighting the potential health
          and well-being risks.
          <br /><br />
          As emphasized by Professor De Simone in numerous conferences and
          publications, many marketed probiotics have not been clinically tested
          or may not correspond to the original clinically tested formulations
          when marketed, causing substantial differences in the safety and
          efficacy of the final product (De Simone C. Clinical Gastroenterology
          and Hepatology Vol. 16 No. 9 2018).
          <br /><br />
          Current regulations often do not require thorough comparative studies
          to ensure that changes in manufacturing processes do not compromise
          the efficacy and safety of the commercially distributed probiotic
          product.
        </p>

        </h1>
        <p>
          The lack of strict regulation and the possibility for manufacturers to
          modify formulations without adequately informing consumers pose a
          threat to public trust. In the past, the De Simone Formulation (DSF)
          was sold under the brand name VSL#3©, by VSL Pharmaceuticals and
          Actial Srl.
        </p>
        <p class="underline">
          In 2019, VSL7#© distributors were found guilty of false advertising
          (for more information:

            >Federal Judge Upholds $18M Verdict, Blocks False Advertising of
            VSL#3, schulman Bhattacharya</span
          >). Recently, the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) has
          updated its guidelines to clarify that pre-2016 literature references
          to VSL#3 exclusively refer to DSF (ECCO, ECCO News,2023). In 2024
          ESPEN (European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism)
          published the article "<span
            >Clarify Correct Amition in Scientific Literature: The Case of the
            DeSimone Formulation and VSL#3©"</span
          >which reiterates the above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The De Simone Formulation is sold under the brand name "Visbiome"¸ in
          the USA and Canada (Exegi) and under the brand name "De Simone
